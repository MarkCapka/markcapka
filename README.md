Hi there, my name is Mark Capka, I am a Software Engineer living in the Pacific Northwest with my wife, Katie, and our two Corgis, Winston and Olive. 

My professional experience is predominantly in .NET/C# programming - with a focus in API integrations and custom Software solutions.

While earning my BS in Computer Science at Eastern Washington University, the curriculum was predominantly taught using C, Java, and C#. I also elected to take courses focussing on Graphics - C++, OpenGL and Unity (C#) with a course in the implementation and use of haptics in virtual reality, big data analytics (spark/hadoop), data visualization (R/Python) , and an Introduction to Deep Neural Networks in which I built an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of large language models and generative AI (Python). 

In my freetime I enjoy camping, fishing, video games - participating in a competitive Pokemon doubles draft league, learning about emerging technologies, and watching Survivor.  

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my code, experiences, or have open positions with your organization.
